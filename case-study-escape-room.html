						<h3>The client</h3>
						<p>Cinévasion is an escape room in Paris near Montparnasse. In addition to their 3 escape rooms, they also offer a private cinema that can be rented for up to 20 people. In our stakeholder interview with co-owner Philippe, we were told that the escape rooms are the core business, but that he felt there was potential to further develop the private cinema. The current website leaves a lot to be desired, and the owners hope to increase conversion.</p>
						<p>For our 8-day sprint we would only be delivering a <strong>mid-fidelity prototype</strong>, focusing on restructuring the information architecture and improving user flow.</p>
						<h3>The current experience</h3>
						<p>The welcome page is extremely long with redundant sections like Contact, which has its own page that can be found in the navigation bar.</p>

						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p>We conducted interviews and ran usability tests of the current site with 5 escape room attendees of various dedication. Here’s what they had to say:</p>
						<ul class="key-quotes">
							<li><span class="big-quote">“</span>I feel overwhelmed and lost when I see this much information on a website.”</li>
							<li><span class="big-quote">“</span>The business should focus more on the escape room—that’s why I’m here!”</li>
							<li><span class="big-quote">“</span>When I see a website like this, I close the window.”</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We also distributed a <a target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/cmwQbt9Lh8dEPjWM8">survey</a>. From its 132 responses, we learned:</p>
						<ul class="key-points">
							<li>72% have already been to an escape room, and 83% of those who haven’t would like to</li>
							<li>83% of those who have been to an escape room book their rooms online</li>	
						</ul>
						<p>Responding to questions about group movie-watching habits and private cinema offers:</p>
						<ul class="key-points">
							<li>57% go to the cinema less than twice a year</li>
							<li>only 6% are willing to pay more than 25€ to rent a private cinema</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Advocating for the user</h3>
						<p>Across those interviewed, immersion into a theme was the most important aspect of an escape room. Cinévasion’s movie-inspired rooms were a plus. But the private cinema offer was confusing with a byzantine booking page, and distracted from visitors’ primary objective—to book an escape room.</p>
						<p>Even with a better site, though, the offer just wasn’t that tempting. Our interviewees preferred to watch movies with small groups at most, and would typically rather watch them at home. The larger a group gets, the harder it becomes to agree on a film.</p>
						<p>We used these findings to craft a user persona that we would refer back to throughout our process. David would be our guiding light as we sought our solution.</p>

						<p>Contrary to Philippe’s assumptions, there simply wasn’t much of a market for the private cinema. The interest in the escape rooms themselves, though, were very promising. Our research showed that return rate of escape-room-goers was extremely high, as was interest in escape rooms from those who’d never been.</p>
						<p>In order to capitalize on this market opportunity though, we would need to improve the experience of Cinévasion’s site visitors.</p>

He is overwhelmed though by too much info on the home page. He manages to find a room that looks promising, his mood picking back up, before he is quickly angered by the payment options. He must either pay the full amount now, or call if he’d prefer to simply pay a deposit, so that his friends can pay the rest upon arrival—a common practice for escape rooms. Finally, David decides to pay the full amount and message his friends. He books the room, hoping it will be better than the website. "

						<h3>Problem statement</h3>
						<p>Escape room enthusiasts need a way to <strong>more efficiently navigate Cinévasion’s website to book an escape room</strong> because they currently get overwhelmed and lost within the site.</p>
						<p>We believe that <strong>streamlining and better structuring the site’s information</strong> will lead to better booking rates.</p>

						<h2>Ideation</h2>
						<p>Guided by our research, we set the following goals for our redesign.</p>
						<h3>Home page</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Simplify the home page, removing redundant elements and making the escape rooms the primary focus.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Navigation</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Condense the extensive navbar, folding redundant elements into related pages. <i>(The English version of the site wasn’t quite as bad, but the French version could barely fit across my monitor, including two extra options and lengthier wording.)</i></li>

						<h2>Retrospective</h2>
						<p>With more time, we could move into the high-fidelity stage and apply paint to our mid-fi designs. Further market research, ideation, and desirability tests would allow us to update Cinévasion’s visual branding and apply this to the prototype. From here, we could move on to handoff.</p>
						<p>We could also conduct further research and redesign the pages for the private cinema and events.</p>
						<p>This project was a great exercise in heavy research of all kinds. When analyzing an existing product, we had to start with heuristics evaluation and usability testing right up front, in addition to user research and market research and positioning.</p>
						<p>It was also a great poster child for the importance of User-Centered Design. Our research led us to recognize that there was a gap in business desires and user priorities. The current site was not satisfactorily taking care of visitors’ primary goal—to book an escape room—and interest in the cinema offer was low. We presented the findings to the stakeholders and secured the go-ahead to put the user first.</p>
