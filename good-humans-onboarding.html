					<div class="text-wrapper">
						<p>Our focus was to build out just part of the MVP that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodhumans.me/">Good Humans</a> would need to launch in 2022. Specifically, we’d be crafting the onboarding process in order to introduce the users to the app, and importantly, vice versa.</p>
						<p>As a brand new app with a subscription model, we would need to use the onboarding screens to pitch the idea quickly and effectively to new downloaders. We must efficiently communicate the value proposition of the app model.</p>
						<p>But crucially, we also have to get to know our users themselves. The idea of the app is to provide personalized action plans with steps each user can take to reduce their environmental impact. In order to provide personalization, we must first know whom we're personalizing for. This meant a questionnaire to assess where users already are on their personal eco-journey, and where they would like to focus their energy.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<!---- RESEARCH ---->
				<section id="research">
					<div class="text-wrapper">
						<h2>Research & insights</h2>
						<p>We began with an <a target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/uioU8AzyijpTfpH29">online survey</a> that generated 98 responses, and by conducting in-depth interviews with five people within our expanded network whom we knew were concerned with their environmental impact to some, if not a great, degree.</p>
						<p>From this research, we gained some key insights:</p>
						<ul class="key-points">
							<li>73% of survey respondents feel lost or overwhelmed at least some of the time when trying to manage their eco-impact.</li>
							<li>Feelings of guilt and anxiety are common. Users want help, but don't want to feel judged.</li>
							<li>Users don’t simply want to be told what to do—they want to be given action to take, step-by-step, in a way that feels manageable.</li>
							<li>84% would be interested in an app that provides guidance and recommendations.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>So the good news was that there’s a clear place in the market for Good Humans and an interest in the product. The difficult news is that managing one’s environmental impact is a heavy subject—so <strong>tone and emphasizing personalization would be key</strong>  as we created the onboarding flow.</p>
						<p>Using these insights we crafted a persona, Camille, to capture the pain points and frustrations of our target users.</p>

Goals & Ambitions: Minimize waste and slowly transition to a zero-waste lifestyle. Be more mindful of her everyday purchases—buy fewer, local goods. Frustrations: Unsure where to find stores nearby that sell local and sustainably-sourced goods. Can feel discouraged by weight of living a low-waste lifestyle."

					<div class="text-wrapper">
						<h3>Hypothesis statement</h3>
						<p>We believe <em>onboarding users to learn their personal priorities and concerns</em> in order to <em>deliver actionable coaching</em> to people who are ready to continue to reduce their environmental impact despite sometimes feeling overwhelmed will <em>encourage them to commit to further lifestyle changes</em>.</p>

						<h2>Ideation</h2>
						<p>Knowing we would be asking users which aspects of environmental impact they felt most passionately about, we began with a round of open card sorting so we could find a shared mental model of categories.</p>
						<p>We then began sketching low-fi screens to start piecing together the steps of the onboarding process.</p>

						<p>With these, we ran five concept tests and then settled on a user flow that we would use to begin creating a mid-fi prototype. The key part of the user flow was determining exactly which questions we would ask the user, and in what order.</p>

						<p>With our mid-fi prototype, we began usability tests which opened our eyes to some aspects that could be improved.</p>

						<p>and finally brings the user to the home page of the app, featuring their personalized plans.</p>
						<h3>High fidelity</h3>
						<p>With our user flow iterations complete, it was time to define the visual style and move into hi-fi.</p>
						<p>Based on our user and competitive research, we knew we wanted the app to have a tone that was:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>warm,</li>
							<li>soft,</li>
							<li>and inviting.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It was also important to the clients that the app interface utilized dark mode. Darker colors consume less energy—especially with modern OLED screens—so designing the app to prolong battery life was a great way for Good Humans to practice what they preach.</p>
						<p>With these principles in mind, we crafted a moodboard that they were very happy with.</p>

						<h2>Delivering the final prototype</h2>
						<p>After exploring a few different styles based on our moodboard and running desirability tests, we settled on one that leaned into the greener earth tones and felt appropriately soft and inspiring. Specifically for the onboarding experience, we wanted to invite the user into an uplifting world with a sense of forward movement.</p>

						<p>In addition to the prototype, we delivered a style guide that could be used as the rest of the app is built out, which includes text styles, a color palette, an icon pack, and styles for interactive elements in all of their states.</p>

						<h2>Retrospective</h2>
						<p>After the completion of this project, my design partner and I were asked by Good Humans to continue working with the team to design the rest of the app.</p>
						<p>The clients made it clear from the beginning that putting the user first is a top priority for them, and this project was a great opportunity for me to align user desires with the business needs of a brand-new startup. I’m excited to continue working with Good Humans and help bring the app to life.</p>
